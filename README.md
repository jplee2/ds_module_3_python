# Data Science Bootcamp Module 3 Challenge: Python


In this assignment I created two Python scripts, one to analyze the financial records of a company and another modernize a vote-counting process.

The financial analysis produced: 
    The total number of months included in the dataset
    The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
    The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


The election script produced:
    The total number of votes cast
    A complete list of candidates who received votes
    The percentage of votes each candidate won
    The total number of votes each candidate won
    The winner of the election based on popular vote
